Respawn targets on game start
Make sure start button also functions as restart
Display instruction text to press yellow button to restart after game finish
Fade out transition to restart - and respawn game objects
Add sound - explosion and "pin" removal once grenade is armed?

	-make sure you put attribution if used
Add target fragmentation upon explosion, and fade out of scene?
	-Add explosion force draft might be useful
Make grenades disappear if not armed and they move out of the player space?

Make game instructions more explicit

-----
Git - make sure you save the scripts AND the project scene AND the project before committing - otherwise project doesnt gets saved to VCS
Don't forget to add from time to time to include new files
Unity won't update public fields if there are compile errors

Simone review-----
yellow box instructions are vague
more instructions
change grenade model to indicate its a bomb
red boxes different sizes
change font for writing - which one?
Instructino writing is too high
