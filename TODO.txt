Fix bug: grenades being dropped out of hand when other grenades go off
Try: giving grenades each a script - the one in your hand should be marked. if the one in your hand explodes - disconnect everything

Comment code and separate out some explosion stuff into separate script
Separate HEIRARCHY into categories too - you can do this with empty objects set at origin and just drag them in


-----
Git - make sure you save the scripts AND the projec before committing - otherwise project doesnt gets saved to VCS
Unity won't update public fields if there are compile errors
