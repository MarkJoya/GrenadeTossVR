Regenerate target
	spawn each prefab with a property of its original location
	then when destroyed retrieve that location and spawn it there?

Comment code and separate out some explosion stuff into separate script
Separate HEIRARCHY into categories too - you can do this with empty objects set at origin and just drag them in
